# Zoombot

Forked on April 28, 2020 from https://github.com/mcreed/Zoombot
Original blog post can be found here https://redpepper.land/blog/zoombot/

## Setup
- Replace the images in /img with your pics
- Put all these files on a server running https:// otherwise Chrome throws security errors and can't access your microphone.
- Visit your Zoombot https:// URL in Chrome
- Turn on Zoombot with the button in the top left and it will start listening for all those key phrases
- Create a virtual webcam with Chrome as the source. I used ManyCam to do this.
- Set your Zoom camera to "ManyCam Virtual Webcam"
- Turn up your speakers
- Talk to your Zoombot <3


## Credits
Credits to Carlos Delgado for making Artyom.js, and to Matt Reed for the initial iteration of this bot.
